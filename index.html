            <h2>What is the TwoDay Method</h2>
            <p>The TwoDay Method is a simple, effective way to track fertility. It involves observing cervical secretions daily and asking two questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Did I note any secretions today?</li>
                <li>Did I note any secretions yesterday?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If the answer is "Yes" to either question, pregnancy is possible today. If the answer is "No" to both questions, pregnancy is unlikely.</p>
            <p>This method is based on the fact that the presence of cervical secretions indicates fertility, while their absence suggests infertility.</p>

            <h2>How to check for the presence of secretions</h2>
            <p>Women can check for secretions by seeing or touching them in their underwear or on toilet paper. Some women prefer to touch their external genitals (vulva).</p>
            <p>Many women soon learn to detect the presence of secretions just by the sensation they feel in their genital area, without needing to touch or see them.</p>
            <p>TwoDay Method users are counseled to check for secretions in whichever way they prefer.</p>
