You can use the TwoDay Fertility Tracker webapp here https://zikalify.github.io/2day/

The webapp can be installed on Android and other operating systems using Chrome by pressing the menu > Add to home screen > install. 
It works offline and all data is stored locally and never transmitted anywhere.
